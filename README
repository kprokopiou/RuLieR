  This Software is the product for the needs of the thesis with the title:
"Analysis, Design and Implementations of an Intelligent Interactive
System for removing rule-lines from document images."
Hellenic Open University, May 2012

  What is the problem that led to creating RuLier?

  The presence of ruling lines is very common in document images in order
to help the writer to keep certain rules e.g. text in order, text inside 
specific area etc. However, the ruling lines make more difficult the
procedures, like document image processing or OCR. Thus, a pre‚Äêprocessing 
step dealing with ruling line detection and removal is required in many cases.

  A variety of algorithms for ruling line detection and removal have
been proposed. These algorithm must solve the following problems
 * Detect the position of the rule lines on the document image.
 * Usually the document images are monochromatic, so there is no
   discrimination between pixels belonging to the rule lines and
   those belonging to the text characters.
 * Rule lines can vary in thickness, may be skewed or be broken
 * When lines and text are overlapped, a decision has to be made if a
   black pixel belongs to a line or a character, in order to turn it off
   or keep it on, respectively.

   The above issues are not trivial at all, especially for images 
  created from handwritten documents. So the algorithms, must
  have a complex logic use parameterization, to be able to adopt
  to the great variety of document images.
  
    Due to the parameterized nature of the algorithms, we must
  have an objective method of evaluating the effectiveness of
  the algorithms. Also, we need an automatized way to select
  the best values for the parameters for a collection of images.

  What RuLieR can do?

  RuLieR is a human computer interaction system that performs the tasks:
  * Image Selection and Display, including zoom in, zoom out,
  * Selection/Insertion of ruling line detection and removal algorithm,
  * Parameter configuration by using an artificial intelligence algorithm,
  * Parameter configuration by user feedback,
  * Algorithm application to a batch of files after the final configuration.
  * Implements three algorithms for rule line detection and removal
  * It is extensible and allows adding more algorithms.

------------------------ INSTALLATION -------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the ./releases directory download rulier-1.0.tbz2
1. Uncompress the file:
   tar -xvjf rulier-1.0.tbz2
2. A directory named 'RuLieR'. The base directory named 'rulier' is created.
   Go inside the directory, and then run the file:
   * run.sh if your operating system is *NIX (such as, Linux)
   * run.bat if your operating system is Windows

Note in order to be able to run the program you need
* The Java Runtime Environment (preferable version 6 or 7)
* In order to be able to open and save in image formats such as TIFF
  you need jai-imageio. Downloable from:
  http://download.java.net/media/jai-imageio/builds/release/1.1/

  Some of the algorithms can use a great deal of memory, 
  so it's recommended a system with a memory at least 4GB
